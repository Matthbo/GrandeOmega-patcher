# Todo
- [X] On Win version if detected, give user the option to install skin
- [ ] Use numbers to select skins instead of typing the name
- [ ] Add full windows support, seperate mac based process from windows based process & create a base for both
- [ ] On GO update, give option to reinstall previously installed skin (check .skin file instead of immediately removing it)
- [ ] Make a dummy install guide (in both dutch & english)
